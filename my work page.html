    <h1>My Work!</h1>
    <p>
        I use my skills in healthcare, coaching, and web development to 
        serve individuals and organizations looking to make health and life better.

    <h2>ðŸ©ºNursing</h2>
    <h3>Compassionate Care, Anywhere</h3>
    <p>
        Iâ€™ve worked in hospitals, health centers, and offshore environments as 
        a Registered Nurse and Platform Medic.
        <ul>
            <li>Acute care and emergency response</li>
            <li>Chronic disease management</li>
            <li>Patient education and health promotion</li>

    <h2>ðŸ§ Health Coaching</h2>
    <h3>Empowering Wellness</h3>
    <p>
        As a coach, I guide people in managing their health through lifestyleâ€”not 
        just medicine. My coaching focuses on:
        <ul>
            <li>Nutrition and meal planning</li>
            <li>Physical activity routines</li>
            <li>Stress  and energy management</li>
            <li>Sleep hygiene</li>
            <li>Weight management</li>
            <li>Blood pressure and blood sugar tracking</li>
            <li>Work-life balance for professional and workers</li>
        </ul>
        I help clients set realistic goals, develop sustainable habits, and
        overcome barriers to their health. <br>
        Book a session or request a wellness guide!

    <h2>ðŸ’»Web Development</h2>
    <h3>Building Health-First Digital Tools</h3>
    <p>
        I build websites and tools that help people learn and take control of 
        their health. <br>
        Projects include:
        <ul>
            <li>Health blogs and articles</li>
            <li>Wellness tracking apps</li>
            <li>Patient education platforms</li>
            <li>Telehealth solutions</li>
            <li>Personal coach portfolio sites</li>
        </ul>
        I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React to build user-friendly 
        interfaces that empower people to take charge of their health.
